🌈 Accessibility Features
The Colorblind-Friendly Theme was designed with inclusivity in mind:

High-contrast colors.
Avoidance of problematic color combinations (e.g., red-green).
Icons and patterns for important alerts, ensuring information is conveyed without relying solely on color.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML: Popup interface.
CSS: Theme styling.
JavaScript: Theme functionality and communication between popup and content scripts.
Chrome Manifest v3: Extension configuration.

📝 Future Enhancements
Add more themes (e.g., High Contrast, Custom Colors).
Allow users to create their own themes via a color picker.
Support for more browsers (e.g., Edge, Firefox).
I would like to provide an opportunity for future students using omnivox to experience working on a public repo, especially on a project they can reap benefits from. Hopefully I will be constantly adding themes and approving themes made by others.
